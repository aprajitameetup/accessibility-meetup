## Testing with Screen Readers

### Recommended Screen Readers

1. **NVDA (Windows)** - Free
   - Download from [nvaccess.org](https://www.nvaccess.org/)
   - Press `Insert + F7` to open elements list
   - Use `D` key to navigate by landmarks

2. **JAWS (Windows)** - Commercial
   - Download trial from [freedomscientific.com](https://www.freedomscientific.com/)
   - Use `Insert + F7` for elements list
   - Use `R` key for landmarks

3. **VoiceOver (Mac)** - Built-in
   - Enable in System Preferences ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí VoiceOver
   - Use `VO + U` for rotor
   - Navigate by landmarks with `VO + Command + L`

4. **Orca (Linux)** - Free
   - Install with `sudo apt install orca`
   - Use `Insert + F7` for elements list

### Testing Steps

1. **Start with Home Page**:
   - Navigate to `/` for overview
   - Review all available demo scenarios
   - Understand the testing approach

2. **Semantic vs Non-Semantic Comparison**:
   - Navigate to `/semantic` - Use screen reader shortcuts to explore landmarks
   - Navigate to `/non-semantic` - Try to navigate by landmarks (there are none!)
   - Notice the dramatic difference in navigation experience

3. **Color Accessibility Testing**:
   - Navigate to `/color-blind`
   - Toggle color-blind simulation mode
   - Compare error visibility in both modes
   - Review contrast ratio explanations

4. **Interactive Demos**:
   - Test `/aria-live` for focus traps and live regions
   - Explore `/checklist` for comprehensive accessibility guidelines
   - Try `/map` for visual accessibility scenarios

5. **Key Differences to Highlight**:
   - Landmark navigation availability
   - Color contrast and accessibility
   - Dynamic content announcements
   - Focus management
   - Overall user experience impact
